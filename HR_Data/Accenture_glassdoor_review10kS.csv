3,Good Company,Recommends,Approves of CEO,I have been working at Accenture full-time for more than 3 years,Good Company. Although it depends on the Project also. Some projects are really busy with lots of work load and some are very chilled out. you will not be asked to stretch or work on weekend until it is very much necessary.,"It has 10 hrs of work timing. Sometimes you feel being a senior employee the work that you are doing is not upto your level. any new comer can also work on your belalf. Although they have an extensive learning portal but learning on project level is quite less sometimes when you are the only resource working in the project in your Technology.

Also, there interview process is not very transparent. Some people dont even get jobs even after clearing all the rounds they are put on hold and no body knows what is the status of your hiring.

Simillarly there internal processes are not transparent you never know when you will be pulled out of the project for a different work and you will not be able to provide your opinion in your hiring or your interest and your experience.",4,Full-Time,0.36575
4,Working environment,Recommends,Positive Outlook,I have been working at Accenture full-time for more than 3 years,"If you are looking for a career in IT services it’s one of those companies to start with however, down the years you might not get what you are expecting so its definitely smart to switch within a year or two.
Its an enterprise where there are many employees so that lower strata of employees never feel much job pressure. But again it's not the place for passionate workers.
Accenture provides you opportunities to learn and get trained in a technology you might feel confident about but it doesn't guarantee you projects on that particular technology always.
at the end , the above points are purely my personal view that I felt in my tenure in Accenture.","There are no cons as such. I found Accenture experience totally subjected to an employee’s nature. If you are introvert and don’t ask for work proactively, you might feel like a tiny fish in a vast ocean, and probably become an unidentified robo in the crowd.

On the other hand, if you are proactive enough to take up any work, asking for more, showing enthusiasm in extra activities, you will end up gaining good visibility that will help rocketing your growth up in Accenture.

Also, Accenture provides free certifications time to time to upskill employees, and in case one gets into a niche skill, bonus is provided.

Other than that if you compare the salary part wih any other service company, you won’t be disappointed, but once compared with other leading product companies, it’s disheartening. And that can be considered as a ‘con’.",4,Full-Time,0.2779

My Italy manager have very good impression on me and it was told to my TL by her. But he never interested to tell the same to my Indian manager.

You need to get out of company just because you cannot take politics any more and also too much politics played in the team to get promotion.

Too much favoritism. 

Promotion preference is given to those who are close to TLs, only then the remaining people will be considered to give promotion.

For example: My TL's best friend got promoted first then the other guy in my team got promoted in the next cycle that too he is having more experience than my TL's best friend.

TLs will intentionally give appreciation mails to those who are favorite to them.

3) salary is good at senior levels","1) Appraisal system is very bad at times you have to remove 15% of folks.plus there are restrictions on whom you can put at that level women can’t be given the bad ratings plus you have to keep women in the team, this means sometimes the percentage of bottom cases moves to 40%.The entire year the year end appraisal keeps playing on the head and employees work in fear . Hence many times not taking risks
2) people at manager and above level are not doing a lot of technical work. It’s mostly client handling, showcasing work within Accenture a, managing resources and escalations

I spend close to 4 years at Accenture, but cannot think of more pro's.","1. Terrible projects. Since 2019, Accenture's graph is going down as far as good clients are concerned.

2. Majority support projects.

3. Terrible Office Politics. People here at Accenture Gurgaon, indulge in office politics more than they involve themselves in work. Accenture is loosing good talent because of that.

4. No learnings. No certifications encouraged. One has to beg management to get approvals.

5. Onshore is purely based on office politics. One who praises management gets it and deserving people always are left out.

6. Out of proportion work. No tasks are pre defined. Accenture's manager sometimes hire people for something else and put them on completely different work.

7. Bad HR policies. HR is suppose to help people with issues, but here the HR reports the complaints directly to management and works on their discretion. Accenture has worst HR policies and everything is on papers. No action is taken on grievances.

8. Mostly night shifts are given to people with whom management has ego issues. It is a kind of punishment one is given for not being a praiser.

9. I repeat, never come to Accenture Gurgaon office. Its the hub of most terrible management as they do less of work and focus majorly on office politics. I think, majority of bad experiences posted here at Glassdoor, are of whom who worked at Accenture Gurgaon offices.",4,Full-Time,0.729675

They say that we do this every year it means they make people jobless even though employees working day and night for their companies.
I worked more that 12 hours for so many day even on weekends and also worked on each day of my 2 week vacation but even though I was asked to Exit.
Here I can blame that Managers and HRs are friends of each other and they do this so that they can save their Jobs and save jobs of the people who do buttering to them.
I have many proofs what happened to me if any senior person of Accenture company want to know what happened with me, I can tell you in details.

Now the point is that Julie Sweet said that they had 4% to 6% growth in 2020 then why did they asked us to exit, growth is because of people like us who works a lot with dedication still do not get good hike or promotion after eligibility.

For new joiners, Accenture has an approximate 2.5 months of Greenfield training. Earlier it used to be a good base for new joiners. Not sure how it works now. But it definitely needs to be upgraded.
The working culture is much better than other service based industries in India. (That’s my experience overall)
The leave policies (medical, vacation, for mothers as well) is pretty good.
You would not be sitting ideal for too long for sure, so if you like being occupied, given work, this is a good place.
During appraisal, you generally get a decent hike (not for people finishing in lowest grade!)
There are people here staying for long tenures of their careers 7–10–12 years. If you are in a comfort zone, you will stay as long as there is a strong reason to switch over.
If you are in a good project, the learning will always be there. It also depends on the attitude of the employee.","Being a service industry, the working hours are sometimes very tedious. 9 hrs of work and add to that the travel time.
The bell-curve has been removed officially. But internally it still exists (Thats what i feel, because otherwise there is no way to rate a person’s performance. Comparison between employees is the only way to rate a person higher or lower based on their performances.) This makes it inevitable for an employee to have a good rapport with your seniors.
Being a service industry, if you are hard core developer, you will not always land up in a proper development role (from scratch). It depends on your luck! At times you might be in support, maintenance projects as well.
In case you want to switch streams or roles, for e.g, switch from being a developer to a tester or from Java to SAP, it might be difficult. It is subject to internal dynamics of the organization.
If you are in this place for a long time, it may be possible, your financial growth would be stagnant. That depends on how the employee perceives it.",5,Full-Time,0.332175

Team leads, Managers and senior managers are literally worried about whom to rate at bottom (as 10% bottom is mandatory) right from beginning of performance cycle. this is not exaggeration, this is a fact, you will come to know once you join. Probably 50% to 70% of the employees worry and live in fear of upcoming rating. (again this is not an exaggeration, join you will realise)
- Bench or so called ITP, is a hell or a place where in employees get to do all junk and non technical work like calling candidates or interviewers and collecting interview slots. If you are more than 3 months in bench/ITP you will end up in capability assessment and then PIP (performance improvement program) and out of the company
- Freshers don't get choice to work on a particular skill or location. Its taken for granted otherwise they will be asked to leave company immediately.
- Managers and senior managers play with rating system. They have vested interest to keep people on project, give bad rating and finally kick them out of project to bench. HR will finally kick them out of the company.
- Immense pressure to relocate while being on bench. e.g. I was about to roll off project next day and i get call from HR/scheduler asking my consent for relocation. This is like creating fear in minds of employees before moving to bench. A person on bench will get call on relocation consent at least once or twice a day being on bench.

-I have seen in other companies where employees keep asking every time of the year when they will receive hike letter. Here by Dec end compensation review letter is officially released, guaranteed, 
- No other company is spending so much on the training as much as Accenture do, and most important here for cloud there is a drive to complete certifications and what Accenture gives free vouchers for certifications with which you can book certification exam for free.
-If you are in Devops technology I must personally suggest get into capability pool (a pool of SMEs from DevOps technology) plenty to learn on various project. Though most of the project may be short term but that gives you plenty of opportunities to learn more in various projects.
- There are projects in Accenture where you can work from home if you are interested. This was there even before covid. howerever my project demanded office work.

I can give honest advice to all of you, if you got offer from Accenture Hyderabad, 1st ask them if it's Synchrony Account. If yes, then trust me stick to your current company or else go somewhere else.But Don't join that project. Your life will be hell there. They will do mental torture. Honestly you will be in very much disturbing state. If you have aspirations to join Politics in future then it's a good option to join this Account to gain political knowledge.

Cons

I can mention as many cons as you want:

1. Salary and Package Stuff: Let's take an example you are working in an organisation as a Software Engineer, you are earning 6 Lac/Annum and having experience of 3 Years in IT. You cleared Accenture interview process (which is generally a cake walk). HR will extend an offer to you. HR will make every possible try to fool you. If you ask for Senior Software Engineer (SSE) Designation, HR will say as per company policy the minimum criterion for SSE is 3.5 Years so we cannot give you. If you ask for money, let’s say 25% hike, HR will say we cannot give that because it will be beyond their standards for a Software Engineer and they cannot go against the policy, but what we can do for you as an exception is that: we can give you the same package along with Joining Bonus which is 10% of Base (60,000) and 18% of variable pay. Variable pay will be payable 2 times (after 6 months). Variable pay also depends upon performance but Accenture is known for giving 100% variable pay to their employees without any deductions. After this most of the people become the prey of HR and join Accenture, but the truth is something different. Read point 2.

2. This is true that you will get joining bonus in the first month salary. But the variable pay will be give only 5-6% (not 18%) for 1 year. This is based on the default rating as per Accenture. No matter how good you perform, you are not going to get your 100% variable pay. 

Example: Let's say you are eligible for 1 Lac Rs in 1 Year as your variable pay. You should be getting this in two parts 50,000 each (assuming you are a good performer and company is also performing well). You will be shocked to see not more than 24,000 Rs after 6 Months (you were expecting 50,000 Rs). This is company policy. HR will not tell you this at the time of joining. You will feel like cheated and surely disappointed.

3. You can find a SSE earning less than a SE and also some SSE earning more than a TL level person. Nothing at all standardised.

4. Promotions: Promotions solely depends upon your relation with your manager and also you may feel left alone(you know what I mean). Any similarity whatsoever with your good performance is purely coincidental. I have seen extremely good people having experience of 5.5 Years at SE level also. Such people are just prey of internal politics. I really feel sad for those chaps.

5. You won't get any opportunity to work on the technology/role you aspired for. Even if you will ask them, Management will give you N no. of reasons and at the end they will put you wherever they want.",2,Full-Time,0.646925

There is a lot about the firm that is great. It is a great culture that values collaboration (below the partner level), that truly values diversity of employees","As noted by many, and as inferred by by comment around individual performance above, if you want to get ahead here you WILL work your rears off. Late nights and weekends, with minimal complaining, are the norm for those who are successful. The firm has tried to add in concepts of ""flexibility"" into our work force - but that is generally ignored in practice by those people actually delivering client work (great thought, poor execution). I know that many complain about what they see as the professional equivalent of ""sweat shop rates"" when it comes to compensation - but I honestly think that is over blown. Sure everyone would love to make more money, but you can make 6 figures as a Senior Associate and almost $300K as a Director PLUS bonus...so, to me, the pay issue falls on deaf ears. The one area that I think we could really improve on is in the area of our 401K matching percentage which is currently $0.25 on the dollar up to 6% of your contribution. Many of our industry clients match dollar for dollar, so quarter for dollar is a bit of a slap in the face. The technology that we use as practioners, for the most part, is terrible with the exception of some of our new web enabled tools for pricing engagements and managing engagement economics. For the last few years there have been many hints and encouragements that we would be replacing the much hated Lotus Notes (that's right boys and girls, we are still using the best of 1990s technology for email and calendaring). There was a great deal of excitement and buzz in the firm - until we were told that we would not be moving to the standard...Microsoft Outlook. Instead - we are ""Going Google"". So, not only are we replacing one terrible system with another, we are not actually getting rid of Lotus Notes at all because 1) the Federal practice can't use gMail (the Feds won't certify the security of gMail's cloud) 2) certain accounts (like Microsoft) won't allow the use of Google products (Microsoft was so angry that they lost the replacement of Lotus Notes that we almost completely lost the account), and 3) the rest of the global firm won't be switching. So we will be having to manage two separate email accounts and will be forced to use the terrible Google Docs over what everyone else in the world uses and likes - Microsoft Office. Why did we select Google, one might ask. The answer varies based on who you ask. Some say it is because Google's cloud based tools will allow us to work in ways that we can't today for collaborating on the creation of documents and through Google's ""Hang Outs""...this is ridiculous because Google's user experience is horrible (else, Microsoft would be losing market share to them in spades), and Microsoft already has the standard for collaboration through Link and Jive. Some say it is because Google's cloud based services provide a lower total ownership cost - which is also ridiculous because Microsoft has Office 365 available through the cloud with Azure. Some say it is because our technology isn't cool which is impacting our ability to attract talent on campus - which is the most ridiculous reason of all because who really joins a company because they can have a gMail account? Also, I'm honestly not sure how we will be expected to use these fabulous tools in an offline capacity when we don't have internet connectivity (such as on a plane that is not equipped with WiFi). The firm is also replacing its current performance management system (and process for handing out annual performance ratings and subsequent merit increases and performance bonuses) with a new system called the PwC Professional. Basically, they are replacing a tried and true system of documenting written performance feedback (which is good for not only developing people but also for serving as a record of what people don't do well in the event an adverse action needs to be taken against an employee) with a mobile app that captures a rating against five dimensions and which replaces written feedback with oral feedback that has no memory and no record. The ""coach"" who used to be responsible for representing their ""coachees"" at the Annual Review Committee time now has almost no role in the performance outcome of their staff displaced by the ""relationship partner"" who has responsibility now to personally know each and every staff member that they represent so that they can represent them to the other partner only ""performance roundtable"" discussions. Partners today have very little time for junior staff, let alone demonstrated interest in their individual careers. So now, a process that was cumbersome but was overly fair (you could only talk about things during ARC time that were documented - if it wasn't documented it was if it never happened and you had at least one person who knew you and advocated for you in the room when your performance was being discussed in the form of your Coach) and very transparent is being replaced with the equivalent of a papal conclave supported by a popularity contest. Additionally, this mobile app (Performance Snapshots), only requires commentary if a staff member is not meeting expectations or is partially meeting expectations...so if you are meeting expectations you can't even comment on performance unless you are highlighting a performance differentiator that they only expect less than 50% of staff to have. Lazy reviewers are incentivized through the design of the app to give everyone a meets expectations on all five dimensions and move on. Our attrition rate has been very low for a professional services firm - it will be interesting to see what happens to attrition after the next round of annual reviews using the new Professional.",4,Full-Time,0.182925

Nobody cares about you as a human being, they just treat you like a slave. They just want to get the work done, they don't care even if you die. If you do die, they'll just replace you within a day. They make you extra, over the weekends and oh those horrible night shifts. 
And most of the time you're just doing repetitive stuff and not learning much. The work is outdated and you will have a hard time finding another job when you decide to leave Accenture. They do not let you switch teams as per your wishes. They will assign work to you randomly and you just have to deal with it. I worked on SAP BOBJ for a year and a half and I was just randomly assigned to an Informatica team. While I had the opportunity to learn new things, my manager just didn't understand when I told him this stuff is new to me. He would throw all the work my way without any help from others and expect me to perform as if I had been working on Informatica all my life. He just didn't give me time to learn.

7823,My Biggest mistake in life. Huge disapointment.,Doesn't Recommend,No Opinion of CEO,I have been working at Accenture,"Really there is nothing to mention over here, but still I must agree that they do not force you to sit beyond 6:30 PM, and if you come late in the morning then nobody asks...  (given that you finish your work ontime). 

Other than that, sorry I have nothing to share.

This company may be considered as good for someone who is not getting any job anywhere else and for fresher’s (maybe).","I can mention as many cons as you want:

1. Salary and Package Stuff: Let's take an example you are working in an organisation as a Software Engineer, you are earning 6 Lac/Annum and having experience of 3 Years in IT. You cleared Accenture interview process (which is generally a cake walk). HR will extend an offer to you. HR will make every possible try to fool you. If you ask for Senior Software Engineer (SSE) Designation, HR will say as per company policy the minimum criterion for SSE is 3.5 Years so we cannot give you. If you ask for money, let’s say 25% hike, HR will say we cannot give that because it will be beyond their standards for a Software Engineer and they cannot go against the policy, but what we can do for you as an exception is that: we can give you the same package along with Joining Bonus which is 10% of Base (60,000) and 18% of variable pay. Variable pay will be payable 2 times (after 6 months). Variable pay also depends upon performance but Accenture is known for giving 100% variable pay to their employees without any deductions. After this most of the people become the prey of HR and join Accenture, but the truth is something different. Read point 2.

2. This is true that you will get joining bonus in the first month salary. But the variable pay will be give only 8% (not 18%) for 1 year. This is based on the default rating as per Accenture. No matter how good you perform, you are not going to get your 100% variable pay. 

Example: Let's say you are eligible for 1 Lac Rs in 1 Year as your variable pay. You should be getting this in two parts 50,000 each (assuming you are a good performer and company is also performing well). You will be shocked to see not more than 24,000 Rs after 6 Months (you were expecting 50,000 Rs). This is company policy. HR will not tell you this at the time of joining. You will feel like cheated and surely disappointed.

3. You can find a SSE earning less than a SE and also some SSE earning more than a TL level person. Nothing at all standardised.

4. Promotions: Promotions solely depends upon your relation with your manager. Any similarity whatsoever with your good performance is purely coincidental. I have seen extremely good people having experience of 5.5 Years at SE level also. Such people are just prey of internal politics. I really feel sad for those chaps.

5. If you were on bench for some time, say 2 months, forget about variable pay. Continuing the above example you are not going to get more than 14,000 (in any case).

6. BEWARE: If you are joining Accenture Gurgaon just only for the Gurgaon location, then this is highly likely that you can soon be relocated mercilessly if you remain on bench for some time. They have all rights to force you. On the day of reporting (1st day in Accenture), they will make you sign a document that states this clause. 

7. Notice Period: As you might be aware that the notice period has been increased to 90 Days. The same has been done for Infosys also. The good news is, if you are under probation period, you can get out of this mess in just 30 days. :)

8. Medical Policy for Parents: Only Employee, his wife and children are ensured. If you are a bachelor and your parents are dependent on you, then sorry, Accenture is not responsible for them. You have to purchase a medical policy for your parents.

9. Accenture doesn't believe in equality. Anybody less than Team Lead level is actually less than a human being. Let me give you one example: If you are at Team Lead level or above only then you will get Car Parking stickers. Below that level, please use company transport. You are not supposed to come by car. And if you prefer to come by bike, please note Accenture has very limited parking. If tokens are not available then wait outside under the sun till the time someone goes out. 

Note: 1. I am talking about Accenture Gurgaon office, DDC2 (Near Signature Tower).
           2. Accenture does not have first in first park policy as it may hurt some project managers and senior management people while waiting outside.
           3. They do have sufficient space to accommodate at least thrice the available car parking (125 slots). But, Accenture is not willing to pay for the additional parking cost for their below TL level servants... oh sorry, employees.

Mind you, Accenture is a 21 Billion + $ revenue generating company.

10. Onsite Opportunities: Depends project to project, but due to huge internal politics, opportunities are limited to the near and dear employees of the project manager.

11. Non-Professional behaviour by the Project Managers and TL level people. North India is generally known for being very non professional and after joining Accenture Gurgaon, I get to know the reason behind such perception. 

Example: Project Manager and TL level believes in oral work related communications (in hindi language, no english please kind of work environment) rather than written. But if you do any mistakes, they will not leave any chance to escalate the matter in written. They does not hesitate using Red colour while composing such mails. This is surely against business ethics.

12. No work from home facility. This facility in only reserved for Project Manager. So, please don't ask for laptops and VPN access. Sorry.

13. Spam Mails: Expect getting approx 25 spam mails from Accenture itself that does not have anything to do with you. 

14. Stationary: This Company is so poor that it will not issue you a single pencil without an online ticket that you have to raise. They call themselves as an environment friendly company that is saving papers that employees used to fill to issue stationary material. I prefer using my own stationary rather than raising new tickets. This is exactly what they want. 

15. This is very small thing but you are going to miss paper towels in washrooms. Again, the answer comes: we are environment friendly company so we do not provide paper towels in washrooms. 
Whenever they want to save money, they say they are environment friendly. You decide. 

16. Security: They don't leave any chance to harass their employees. 

Security Check-1: The drama starts in the morning when you reach the barrier (just before the building, near the NH-8 highway). Some illiterate, ill-mannered security guards will welcome you and pretend to check your car by looking inside the car and will smash the boot door of your loving car. Goshh!!! what a bad feeling it is... You will fell like killing him, but you cannot do anything, sad.  

Security Check-2: Once you cross the barrier, the same brutal treatment is waiting for your car again. Yes, another security check. Your car boot will be opened and smashed again without being looked at inside. They say they are checking for explosives. God knows how they determine without looking inside. 

Security Check-3: Let’s move on, park your car. On the parking exit towards the lift, you will meet one more security guard who will ask you to show your carry bag/laptop bag etc. This guy is amazing; he will unzip and zip the bag without even looking into that. 

Security Check-4: Once you reach your floor you will meet one more security guard that will again pretend to check your bags. 

I would have been more than happy if they were actually doing a security check. The fact is they are just pretending do it, wasting your time and damaging your car. Believe me, nothing more than that.

17. Cafeteria: Everything is paid. Vendors are pathetic. You will feel regretted after spending your hard earned money on the pathetic food. 

You will get lunch @ 45 Rs (full plate). It will be fixed quantity, no buffet system at all. Please do not dare asking for more, you will get a blunt/rude reply only.  

If you are coming from a product based company, you are going to miss those luxuries and good behaviour of office boys.

18. Medical Facility: In papers, every day a doctor is available from 3PM to 5 PM on weekdays. But, at the most he/she comes 2 times in a week only. 

19. No AC facility in cabs. Employees have to pay directly to the cab drivers if they wish AC to be turned on. 
I feel pity for my fellow colleagues who come from Noida and surrounding areas in non-AC cabs in Summers of Northern India where the temperature touches 45 Degrees Celsius.

20. Dress Code: As in many service based companies, here also you have to follow the dress code. You need to wear formals (except Friday). On Fridays, you cannot wear round neck T-Shirts. 
Your supervisor has all rights to fine you Rs 500 if found guilty for violating this ""LAW"" for the first time, if you are unlucky enough to be caught second time then you will be sent home and it will be considered as PTO (Paid Time Off). Awesome!

Also, you are not supposed to wear Shirt/T-shirt bearing any corporate logo other than Accenture logo. That means, even if you are coming from Microsoft, you cannot wear a T-Shirt/Shirt having Microsoft logo or its name.

21. Oops... I forgot to tell you about HR. Accenture HR people are the most useless people in the world. There is ZERO co-ordination between them. When your interview process is going on, believe me, nobody knows where the process actually is. They will literally call you and ask you, what all rounds have been done with you. Anybody will wake up and call you from their department. In my case, after getting the offer letter, one HR called me to schedule the technical interview. Can you believe this? They don't know if the candidate has already gone through the selection process or not. I spoke to 12 different HR people during my selection process. I am sure ""each"" Accenture employee will agree on this without exception.

22. Long working hours (8:30 AM to 6:30 PM). People using company transport has to follow these timings, others come late generally.

I hope these points are enough to open your eyes. Would that, I were knowing these things before joining Accenture, Gurgaon!!!",3,Part-Time,0.555275

Top executive committee should actually conduct the review of past 8-10 years ways of working of Indian Leadership and the HR policies and the promotions they have done. People they have removed, people who resigned and their comments 
Gender diversity is good but is depriving the real worthy candidates for promotion for Men is not good for the company.

Only when escalation is there, they think the guys are working hard and work is complex. 
If a person works without letting the escalation from client and onsite management, they think it is simple job.
For promotion you need to be in the books of MDs and SMs for M level and for other levels SMs and Ms.

8301,"Over marketisation for Technology and Innovation, Rigid Policies",Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,I worked at Accenture full-time for more than a year,It's has a great brand name in the market obviously due to over marketizing themselves. you will have a great and supportive team where everyone wants to leave as soon as they get an offer from other organizations. Work-life balance is very good depending upon the project. It was the best Service based company but now the many new players are coming in the market with a much better impact.,They have some of the rigid policies which not only affect them but employees also to a large extent. Beware of the fact whether you belong to Accenture or Avanade. Accenture has better structured and flexible with the employees. But if you belong to Avanade run away as fast as possible. You will be stuck with the so-called Microsoft technology where your primary job will be to support these technologies. Most of the Accentures policies don't apply to Avanade people. If you are joining as a fresher then think again and try your best not to join this company. You can't move outside of Avanade technologies except quitting and that's the truth. The micromanagement of employees is at the apex and don't forget about the politics part. If you are not good with the technologies you have to be good with the politics otherwise sorry to say you will be always the victim. Let's just the attrition rate is growing in this organization just like India's GDP falling.,2,Full-Time,0.508225
8302,"Unethical, Immoral - Not a good place for lateral hires",Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,I worked at Accenture full-time for more than 5 years,"Good infrastructure, transportation services, Employees at TL and above get to define their salary structure and can opt for a Higher basic (thereby ensuring that they get to save more using PF [12% of basic]).","1. Each year, there is a mandate by the HR team to identify a bottom candidate across career levels. This is not an ideal scenario for anyone, neither for the supervisors who are forced to identify a bottom candidate by their Delivery Leads nor for the candidate who will eventually be ranked as bottom and be selected for a managed exit. If you are not good with your boss or higher ups, you can be a potential candidate to be ranked as bottom (this is all the more applicable for resources in Supervisory roles (TLs and above)).
There have been instances where roles are created to hire external resources simply to protect the existing lot (at AM and above levels). No matter how pathetic and incapable some of these guys are, they tend to cling on like parasites and are protected by their supervisors. 
Advice for laterals (AM and above positions) - Make sure you do a thorough check on who the hiring manager is, his/her qualities, the team that you are going to be a part of etc. before joining this company. 

2. Doctors hired for their domain expertise being promoted as Delivery/Project managers. Needless to say while these candidates might be good in Healthcare, they lack adequate knowledge and are poor when it comes to knowledge on the SDLC, STLC etc. Some are good at Story-telling and this helps them in masking their deficiencies. Some of these doctors (PMs) are unfit to be working in the area of Project management, they have no clue on Project estimation, software testing etc. They tend to get away with it by abstaining from getting involved in projects and getting themselves involved in Industry initiatives and by working on some RFPs.

3. In some cases, the Project manager and the Senior manager/Associate Director are barely involved in monitoring the overall health of the project. There are no weekly or monthly connects to discuss project health and they tend to step in only when there is a client escalation & try to figure out what went wrong, neither are there any connects to discuss the employee concerns.

4. Asking for roll-off from a project is akin to a resource committing a crime. Such resources will be targeted and planned to be ranked as a bottom candidate in the performance appraisal cycle. Its as though the project manager owning the resource, if the resource asks for a roll-off for whatever reason, then the PM sees that resource as his bottom resource for the FY & efforts are made to ensure that the resource is sent out from the firm.

5. All this talk of an open culture and strong Ethics at the workplace and them encouraging people to voice out their concerns promising appropriate action if the employee is mistreated by their peers or their supervisors is just a SHAM!!!

Do not fall for it. The HR team and the Employee Relations team are absolutely powerless and are just like Puppets. They want to keep their jobs safe and don't necessarily want to go against what the Leadership team wants. If you run into problems at work with your manager in terms of being overlooked for a promotion or are being threatened by your manager that he/she will rank you bottom and put you on PIP etc., then, it means that its time for you to move on from this place. Don't bother raising grievances (addressed by HR team) or logging Ethical complaints (addressed by Employee Relations team), coz nothing will work.",6,Full-Time,0.478

- Accenture Chennai is the worst company I ever seen. 

- Which is filled with 100% management politics.

- Worst management team.

- Management team don't give complete variable pay or even 50% from it. so that management team can increase their income. but actually, variable pay is also a part from salary.

- In fact, Worst management team will showcase one's hardwork as work of another team, whom actually not even involved 5% of work activities.

- They always tell a word (Visibility) for everything, if they see only visibility then better Accenture can recruit Television/movie actors for more visibilty.

- If employee forget ID , then we have to 200.00 RS as deposit because they don't trust employee. Accenture need to understand that employees are not strangers, they won't run away by taking their ID card.

- If employee lost their ID, then employee need to go outside and search for post office/bank, then have to take demand draft and the process will kill you before you complete.
